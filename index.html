      <h2>Popular Interior Designs</h2>
	  <h3>Modern Interior Designing</h3>
         <p>In its simplest sense, modern design refers to the reflection of modern art movements in the interiors of a home. With roots in Scandinavian and German architecture and design, modern style concepts are decidedly fuss-free and simple. ... And when it comes to contemporary interior design styles, you may see hits of color.        <br /></p>

	  <h3>Contemporary Interior Designing</h3>
        <p>Contemporary, at its core, refers to “of the moment,” which illustrates that contemporary interior design styles refer to current design trends while paying homage to the past. Dating back to the 1970's, contemporary style is truly unique as it borrows elements from several other design styles.        <br /></p>

	  <h3>Industrial Interior Designing</h3>
         <p>Industrial style as the name implies, draws inspiration from a warehouse or an urban loft.There’s a sense of unfinished rawness in many of the elements, and it’s not uncommon to see exposed brick, ductwork and wood. An iconic home with an industrial design theme would be a renovated loft from a former industrial building.Think high ceilings, old timber and dangling metal light fixtures with sparse functional furniture.  <br></p>

	  <br><h3>Scandanvian Interior Designing</h3>
	     <p>Scandanvian design plays homeage to the simplicity of life demonstrated in Nordic countries. Scandanvian furniture design often feels like a work of art, although it is simple and understated. There's functionality in the furniture along with some interesting lines, many of which have a sculptural influence. Other common characteristics include all white colour palettes and the incorporation of natural elements like form-pressed wood. </p>

	   <h3>Minimalist Interior Designing</h3>
          <p>The minimalist concept is one that’s popular here in Australia. It takes notions of modern design and simplifies them further.Colour palettes are neutral and airy; furnishings are simple and streamlined, and nothing is excessive or flamboyant in accessories or décor.Minimalism is ultimately defined by a sense of functionality and ultra-clean lines.</p></div>
